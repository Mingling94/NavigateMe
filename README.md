A pebble application that helps users to locate their friends with their pebble. This applications utlizes geotracking and informs the user about how far away they are from the destination or friend and also tells them which direction to go towards. The final design thus far is hardcoded to only direct you towards troy NY and is inacurrate in distance. This was designed and developed at HackBU 2015. #TeamFirstHackathon
